# Sample Groups File for Custom Assembly Strategy
# ================================================
# TSV file with exactly 2 columns: sample_id and group_id
# Each sample must belong to exactly one group
# All samples in the pipeline must be present in this file
#
# Group recommendations:
# - Group biologically related samples (same patient, same treatment, etc.)
# - Keep groups to ~10 samples or fewer for best assembly quality
# - Groups >10 samples will generate a warning but will still run
#
# Format: sample_id<TAB>group_id
