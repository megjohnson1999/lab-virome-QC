# =============================================================================
# Example Config: Assembly from Pre-Cleaned Reads
# =============================================================================
# This configuration skips QC and starts assembly from pre-cleaned reads.
# Use this when you already have cleaned reads from a previous QC run or
# another pipeline.
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
# - Cleaned reads must be in paired-end format:
#   {sample}_R1.fastq.gz and {sample}_R2.fastq.gz
# - Files must be in the directory specified by cleaned_reads_dir
#
# Usage: snakemake --configfile config/examples/config_assembly_from_cleaned.yaml
# =============================================================================

output_dir: "results_assembly_only"

# Pipeline control
pipeline:
  start_from: "cleaned_reads"   # Skip QC, start from cleaned reads
  run_assembly: true            # Run assembly module
  assembly_strategy: "coassembly"  # Combine all samples
  cleaned_reads_dir: "path/to/cleaned/reads"  # ⚠️ UPDATE THIS PATH!

# Assembly parameters
assembly:
  min_contig_length: 1000       # Keep contigs >= 1kb

# Samples - specify manually or use auto-detection
# NOTE: Sample names must match filenames in cleaned_reads_dir
samples:
  sample1:
    # Paths not used when start_from="cleaned_reads"
    # But sample names must be defined
    r1: "dummy"
    r2: "dummy"
  sample2:
    r1: "dummy"
    r2: "dummy"

# OR use auto-detection (sample names from cleaned_reads_dir)
# sample_auto_detection:
#   enabled: true
#   input_dir: "path/to/cleaned/reads"  # Same as cleaned_reads_dir
#   r1_pattern: "*_R1.fastq.gz"
#   r2_pattern: "*_R2.fastq.gz"
