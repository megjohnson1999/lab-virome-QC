# =============================================================================
# Lab Virome QC Pipeline Configuration - Multi-Directory Example
# =============================================================================
# This configuration demonstrates automatic sample detection from MULTIPLE directories
# Useful when your samples are spread across different locations

# Output directory
output_dir: "results"

# Quality filtering parameters
quality_threshold: 20  # Phred quality score (Q20 = 99% accuracy)
min_read_length: 100   # Minimum read length after trimming (higher for library prep artifacts)

# Reference databases
references:
  # PhiX174 reference genome (Illumina sequencing control)
  phix: "resources/phix174.fasta"

  # Host genome for depletion
  # Replace with your host organism (human, mouse, etc.)
  host_genome: "resources/host_genome.fasta"

  # rRNA database - should include both SSU (16S/18S) and LSU (23S/28S)
  # Note: SSU-only databases (common for 16S amplicon work) will not remove LSU rRNA
  # Recommended: SILVA SSURef + LSURef combined (see README for download instructions)
  # Download from: https://www.arb-silva.de/download/archive/release_138_1/Exports/
  rrna: "resources/silva_rrna.fasta"

# Sample information - not used when auto-detection is enabled
samples: {}

# Multi-directory auto sample detection (NEW FEATURE!)
# Automatically finds all paired-end samples from MULTIPLE directories
sample_auto_detection:
  enabled: true

  # Multiple directories containing your fastq.gz files
  # Can be relative paths, absolute paths, or a mix of both
  input_dirs:
    - "data/raw"                          # Relative path
    - "data/additional_samples"           # Another relative path
    - "/path/to/external/samples"         # Absolute path
    - "data/pilot_study"                  # Yet another directory

  # Glob patterns for paired-end reads
  # The '*' wildcard will match the sample name
  r1_pattern: "*_R1.fastq.gz"
  r2_pattern: "*_R2.fastq.gz"

  # Conflict resolution strategy for duplicate sample names
  # Options:
  #   "error"     - Stop with error if duplicates found (default)
  #   "prefix_dir" - Add directory name prefix (e.g., "dir1_sample1", "dir2_sample1")
  #   "newest"    - Use sample from most recently modified directory
  conflict_resolution: "prefix_dir"

  # NOTE: Cannot use both 'input_dir' and 'input_dirs' - choose one!
  # For single directory, use the original 'input_dir' configuration

# QC thresholds for flagging problematic samples
qc_thresholds:
  min_enrichment_score: 10      # ViromeQC enrichment score
  max_host_percent: 10          # Maximum % host reads (VLP failure if exceeded)
  max_rrna_percent: 20          # Maximum % rRNA after removal
  min_final_reads: 100000       # Minimum reads after all QC
  max_duplication_rate: 80      # Maximum % duplication

# Computational resources
# Adjust based on your system
resources:
  default_threads: 8
  default_mem_mb: 16000
